## Data Analysis and Information Exploitation (ADEI - Third Year Subject @UPC-FIB)

> 
**Subject Description:** The aim of ADEI is to provide students with the knowledge and skills to be able to deal with the information needs of organizations, that is, to know how to take advantage of the data stored by the IS of the organizations in order to integrate automatic systems help in decision-making. The underlying idea is that data is a treasure for organizations and that through their exploitation the information they contain is revealed. The subject is developed from the resolution of the problems of a real practical case. It is divided into four blocks: Data quality and summary description. Prediction tools in organizations, multivariate analysis of data and establishment of typologies. The course includes the presentation of results obtained in the case study


## Case Study: UKs Used Cars, from Multivariant Data Analysis to Predictive Modeling 

The case study encompasses three primary deliverables, culminating in a final submission and a presentation to draw insightful conclusions. 
Aim is to predict how much you should sell your old car. It involves a numeric outcome. As a secondary objective, given car characteristics you will have to predict if it refers to an Audi car.


- **[Deliverable 1](https://github.com/Aerosophia/ADEI-FIB/tree/main/D1 "Deliverable 1")**: EDA and data qaulity
- **[Deliverable 2](https://github.com/Aerosophia/ADEI-FIB/tree/main/D2 "Deliverable 2")**: PCA, CA, MCA and diverse Clustering thechniques.
- **[Deliverable 3](https://github.com/Aerosophia/ADEI-FIB/tree/main/D3 "Deliverable 3")**: Predictive models building.

### Final Conclusions:

- **[Final Document:](https://github.com/Aerosophia/ADEI-FIB/blob/main/Final/SoukainaMahboubMehboub-DelFinalRmd.pdf )** This document englobes all the steps from initial data exploratory analysis to model building with more details.
